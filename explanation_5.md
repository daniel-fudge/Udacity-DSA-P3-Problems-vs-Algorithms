# Problem 5 of the Data Structures Project
This problem follows a set Workbook from Udacity that was completed and saved [here](Trie.ipynb) as directed in the 
Udacity problem 5 description. As this follows the set Workbook and special instructions, it is assumed that the rubric 
and general submission instructions do not apply to this question.   

Note I've raised the following [issue](https://knowledge.udacity.com/questions/852401) on the Udacity Knowledge forum to 
update the rubric and general submission instructions to clarify exactly how to handle this question.
