# Udacity Data Structures & Algorithms Nanodegree - Project 3
This is the third project of the Udacity Data Structures & Algorithms Nanodegree. This project comes at the end of the 
Basic Algorithms section, which covers:
1. Basic Algorithms
2. Sorting Algorithms 
3. Faster Divide & Conquer Algorithms

## Project Overview
This project is divided into seven separate problems. The rubric for the solutions can also be found [here](https://review.udacity.com/#!/rubrics/2498/view).

### Problem 1 - Square Root of an Integer
See [explanation_1.md](explanation_1.md) for more details and [problem_1.py](problem_1.py) for the solution. 

### Problem 2 - Search in a Rotated Sorted Array
See [explanation_2.md](explanation_2.md) for more details and [problem_2.py](problem_2.py) for the solution. 

### Problem 3 - Rearrange Array Digits
See [explanation_3.md](explanation_3.md) for more details and [problem_3.py](problem_3.py) for the solution. 

### Problem 4 - Dutch National Flag Problem
See [explanation_4.md](explanation_4.md) for more details and [problem_4.py](problem_4.py) for the solution. 

### Problem 5 - Autocomplete with Tries
See [explanation_5.md](explanation_5.md) for more details and [Trie.ipynb](Trie.ipynb) for the solution. Note this 
question is a copy of the Udacity Notebook, instead of pure python code.   

### Problem 6 - Unsorted Integer Array
See [explanation_6.md](explanation_6.md) for more details and [problem_6.py](problem_6.py) for the solution. 

### Problem 7 - Request Routing in a Web Server with a Trie
See [explanation_7.md](explanation_7.md) for more details and [problem_7.py](problem_7.py) for the solution.
